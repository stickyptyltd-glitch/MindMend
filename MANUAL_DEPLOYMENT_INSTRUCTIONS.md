## 🛠️ **MANUAL DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

**Server Administrator needs to execute these commands:**

### Step 1: Access Server
```bash
# SSH to server (you'll need working SSH access)
ssh [your-working-user]@67.219.102.9

# Or use Vultr/hosting provider console access
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
cd /var/www/mindmend
# OR wherever the application is located
```

### Step 3: Pull Latest Changes

```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
# If new Python packages were added
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If using virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Restart Application
```bash
# If using systemd service
sudo systemctl restart mindmend.service

# OR if using gunicorn directly
sudo pkill -f gunicorn
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app &

# OR if using pm2
pm2 restart mindmend

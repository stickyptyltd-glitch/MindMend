## 📈 What's Working

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Main application accessible at http://34.143.177.214
- ✅ Health endpoint responding
- ✅ Admin panel rendering properly
- ✅ Database connections stable (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- ✅ Background workers running (Celery)
- ✅ AI services available (Ollama)
- ✅ Load balancing operational (Nginx)

### Infrastructure
- ✅ All 10 pods running without restarts (except Nginx: 2 restarts in 44h)
- ✅ Persistent storage mounted (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- ✅ Networking configured (ClusterIP + LoadBalancer)
- ✅ Health checks passing

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Notes

1. **SSL Certificate**: cert-manager attempting ACME challenge (404 responses)
   - Likely needs ingress configuration or DNS verification
   - Currently accessible via HTTP only

2. **Uncommitted Changes**: 139 deleted files + 33 modified files in working directory
   - Mostly cleanup of backup files
   - Non-critical for production operation

3. **Dual Platform**: StopCycle deployment also running (stopcycle-deployment pod)
   - Multi-tenant architecture active
   - Both platforms sharing infrastructure

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Recommended Priority Order)

### Immediate (Phase 2)
1. **Endpoint Testing** - Execute ENDPOINT_TESTING_PLAN.md
   - Test critical user flows
   - Document broken routes
   - Prioritize bug fixes

2. **SSL Configuration** - Fix cert-manager ACME challenge
   - Verify DNS pointing to LoadBalancer IP
   - Check ingress configuration
   - Enable HTTPS access

3. **Admin User Creation** - Create first super admin
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO admin_user (email, name, password_hash, role, is_active)
   VALUES ('admin@mindmend.xyz', 'Super Admin', '<hash>', 'super_admin', true);
   ```

### Short-term (Phase 3)
4. **Professional Portal** - Complete professional management features
5. **Documentation** - Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture
6. **Monitoring** - Set up Grafana dashboards for GKE metrics

### Medium-term (Phase 4+)
7. **Feature Roadmap** - Implement MENTAL_HEALTH_ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md
   - Physical health integration
   - Social connection features
   - Advanced therapeutic technologies
